    # ================================== Logging ===================================

    # Sets log level. The default log level is info.
    # Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
    #logging.level: debug

    # At debug level, you can selectively enable logging only for some components.
    # To enable all selectors use ["*"]. Examples of other selectors are "beat",
    # "publisher", "service".
    #logging.selectors: ["*"]

    # ============================= X-Pack Monitoring ==============================
    # Filebeat can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
    # cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
    # reporting is disabled by default.

    # Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
    #monitoring.enabled: false

    # Sets the UUID of the Elasticsearch cluster under which monitoring data for this
    # Filebeat instance will appear in the Stack Monitoring UI. If output.elasticsearch
    # is enabled, the UUID is derived from the Elasticsearch cluster referenced by output.elasticsearch.
    #monitoring.cluster_uuid:

    # Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
    # Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
    # Note that the settings should point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
    # Any setting that is not set is automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch
    # output configuration, so if you have the Elasticsearch output configured such
    # that it is pointing to your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster, you can simply
    # uncomment the following line.
    #monitoring.elasticsearch:

    # ============================== Instrumentation ===============================

    # Instrumentation support for the filebeat.
    #instrumentation:
    # Set to true to enable instrumentation of filebeat.
